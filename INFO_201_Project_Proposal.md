### 1.0 Introduction

#### 1.1 Problem Situation.

> The direct stakeholders of the problem situation are government policymakers, national homeland security departments, and terrorist organizations. Because of divergent ideologies in politics, culture, and other factors, terrorism is still a threat and a problem to the civil society of some countries. It is important to be inclusive in every community in the society in order to address the potential threat of terrorism to the country, regardless of motives, race, and culture.  Valuing humanity and people’s equal rights play a key role in this case. Public policy implementation of the national government, the United Nations, and other international NGOs that aim to address the terrorism problem would help reduce the threat of terrorism if the issue could eventually be mitigated around the world.


#### 1.2 What is the problem?
> The threat from terrorism remains high and could worsen over the decade. There are now more Islamist extremists from more countries active in more places than ever before. Extremists will continue to exploit fragile and violence-prone states, including in Southeast Asia. Globally, terrorism will add to instability and drive international security interventions, especially in the Middle East and Africa. According to an online summary of terrorism, over the past decade terrorism killed an average of 21,000 people each year. In 2017, terrorism is responsible for 0.05% of global death. In addition, the problem of terrorism is so complex because different cultures and ideologies define terrorism in various ways, and incidents happen in different ways that people have no time reacting. These facts are striking to the world suggesting that it is the problem that we humans should be aware of and take initiatives.  

#### 1.3 Why does it matter?

> The global problem of terrorism threatens not only the national security of a country, the well-being of a society,  but most importantly, the security of citizens’ property and safety of their lives. So many innocent lives were lost because of terrorism attacks. Terrorism also has great impact on international relations. After 9/11, the US government has unprecedentedly increased attention and actions towards terrorism because thousands of people were injured and killed during the attack. The terrorist organization had declared to kill Americans because of US previous support to their opponents, which countered their interests. After two decades, the complexity of terrorism can only increase given the current perplexing international relations in regions, such as Middle East. Therefore, the issue matters to all citizens who embrace peace and well-being of the world.

#### 1.4 How it will be addressed?

> We plan to analyze global terrorism issue in the global scale. Specifically, we will address the possible correlation between countries, casualty, and types of attack and weapons used. We will discuss how are terrorism related to each variable, how they affect each other, and eventually draw conclusions from our data analysis . We will present our result utilizing knowledge we learned in class about data manipulation and visualization.


### 2.0 Research Questions

> RQ1: What is the relationship among weapons types, casualty, and regions throughout history?

> RQ2: What is the trend of global terrorism throughout the history in certain decades? What is the trend of US terrorism throughout history in certain decades?

> RQ3: What country(s) has been most affected by terrorism?


### 3.0 Possible data sets
##### Data set 1: Global Terrorism Database

> "The GTD includes systematic data on international as well as domestic terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes over 190,000 cases. For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and -- when identifiable -- the identity of the perpetrator."

Number of Observations: 191,465,
Number of Attributes: 20

##### Data set 2: Terrorism Cases 2011-2016

> “This dataset lists all individuals who have been charged with or died engaging in jihadist terrorism or related activities inside the United States, and Americans accused of such activity abroad. Years indicate the year that individuals were charged or – if they weren't charged – the year that they died.”

Number of observations: 219,
Number of Attributes: 29

This graph shows the terrorist incidents worldwide. We are planning to create an interactive map for the global terrorism in each county or region.

### 5.0 Team Coordination
a) Each member of our group is committed to meet from 3pm to 5pm every Sundays.

b) Individual goal and roles:
> Jerry: My role in the group is to analyze the problem and datasets, to transform data into helpful knowledge that completes the project and reflect upon different ideas to help the group better coordinate. My goal is to find a problem that we care and is important in real life so that we could work with passion and be proud of it.
<br><br />
Xinye: I would like to gain insights about terrorism in the U.S through our research and data visualizations in the project. I help coordinate the team communication and GitHub repository as well as wrangling data.
<br><br />
Clover: Through this project, I hope I can learn more about the causes of the terrorism which is a problem that I feel when I came to Seattle. I also hope to learn the application of R with datasets in the real world. My role in the project is helping the team to wrangle the data and revise the whole project.
<br><br />
Yichi: Looking for dataset about terrorism in each county, arranging and wrangling data, and creating data visualization.

c) We commit to communicate through group chats as soon as we have thoughts, problems, and insights about the project.

d) We commit to communicate in a timely and straightforward manner. Each member of our group is committed to be aware of our own work breakdowns, and we will communicate frequently to avoid challenges throughout the quarter.
