  "Terrorism has been one of the ugliest crimes of humanity and is becoming 
  one of the worst nightmares of modern society. Terrorist attacks mostly aim 
  to pursue political purposes, deter religious enemies, or spread hatred by 
  hurting and killing completely innocent civilians. Terrorists have grown 
  dramatically in number and spread in range in the 21st century. Due to the development
  of technology and weaponry, modern terrorist attacks are more organized, dangerous
  , and lethal. Over the past decade, terrorism killed an average of 21,000 people globally 
  each year. Therefore, we realize that Fighting terrorism has become a significant and 
  global mission, not only for governments, but also for every individual."

  "In our project 
  Global Anti-Terrorism, we hope to raise awareness of the general public by presenting 
  real facts and data, and also help the government or security departments to better
  understand and prevent terrorism by exploring and summarizing terrorist attacks in 
  the past. In a group of four members, we cooperatively created an interactive shiny 
  application using R studio. We acquired dataset from National Consortium for the Study
  on Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, and extracted the most useful cases that could 
  potentially carry patterns and key information to analyze. We also created technical
  report, visualizations, and conclusions around the data to help the audience comprehend 
  our work and utilize our result. We hope that you enjoy exploring our project and world 
  peace can finally be achieved someday with our collective effort."

background <- (
  "Because of divergent ideologies in politics, culture, and other factors, 
  terrorism is still a threat and a problem to the civil society of some countries. 
  It is important to be inclusive in each society in order to address the potential threat
  of terrorism to the country, regardless of motives, race, and culture. 
  Valuing humanity and people's equal rights play a key role in this issue. Public policy
  implementation of the national government, the United Nations, and other international NGOs
  that aim to address the terrorism problem would help reduce the threat of terrorism if the issue could eventually be mitigated around the world. 
  
  Our group realized that even though terrorism sometimes does not cause a great number of casualties, 
  terrorism provokes deep fear and insecurity more than other forms of violence. Terrorists strike innocent
  civilians randomly and without warning. The national governments think they are capable of protecting their
  citizens against other forms of violence, but all people, in general, feel defenseless against terrorists.
  We would like to analyze the trends of past terrorist attacks to study on the potential correlation among weapons types, 
  attack types, and casualty numbers in the global scope by country over the last twenty years."

Vis_1_analysis <- (
  "This map presents the all terrorist attacks occurred in the 21st century on a world map.
  Users may select a year on the side panel and every red circle is a case. The sizes of the
  circles depend on the casualty number of the cases. By comparing the map from each year, it
  is obvious that terrorist attacks occur most frequently in the Middle East, central America,
  and East and North Africa in the 21th century. The reasons why these areas are more dangerous
  are usually stem from unstable political situations of some countries, collusions between races
  and religions, and the actions from local terrorist organization. Some notable events in the 
  history are visible on the map as well. For example, 9.11 terrorist attack creates a giant 
  circle on North America on 2001, and Russia, rarely had large terrorist attacks, had rather 
  large cases in 2000."
)

Vis_2_analysis <- (
  "This map paints each country according to the number of casualties in terrorist attacks of that year. 
  The lighter color of the map means the larger number of casualties the country had in a particular year.
  This map provides great advantages when it comes to comparing the terrorism severity by country. 
  Users can also focus on some particular country of their interests to study the change of casualty 
  number throughout history.Base on observation, it can be concluded that Iraq stood out as the country
  that had the most casualty over the past two decades. Some middle Asian countries have worse conditions in the recent years."
)

Vis_3_analysis <- (
  "We can observe from the visualization that the most used weapon types in global terrorist 
  attacks from 2000 to 2018 were explosives, and the second being firearms. The average casualty numbers 
  in the 19 years caused by explosives is approx. 30,568 people. The casualty number caused by explosives 
  had a salient increase from 2012 to 2018: the percentage growth from 2012 to 2013 is 60% in a single year
  and the most casualty caused by explosives occurred in 2015 being 49,000 people. The average casualty numbers
  caused by firearms is approx. 6,710 people. The casualty number caused by firearms fluctuated particularly from 2010 to 2018:
  the percentage growth from 2013 to 2014 is 100% in a single year, but it did not represent the whole trend. Moreover, Melee and
  incendiary are the third and fourth most used in global terrorist attacks, yet the casualty numbers are relatively small compared
  to explosives and firearms. The reason might be that explosives and firearms are more powerful in terms of lethality and
  impacted area; whereas, Melee and incendiary are more likely human conflicts with weapons of less lethality. Vehicle bomb,
  one unique weapon type, was used in 2001 with the casualty number of 2,5000 people; it was probably because of the 911 attack in the US.
  It was used only in one year and cannot be taken into account as a common weapon type."
)

Vis_4_analysis <- (
  "The horizontal bar graph shows the total number of casualties caused by different attack types from
  2000 to 2018. It is easier to compare the total casualties caused by one specific attack type over
  different years. Overall, 2014 has the most casualties in the kidnapping, armed assault; 2017 has the most casualties
  in the unarmed assault; 2015 has the most casualties from lots of different attack types, which indicates 
  that 2015 is the year that a lot of people were injured by the terrorists. There is an outlier in the hijacking, 
  which is the year of 2001. This was probably due to the 911 event that took place in America."
)

conclusion1 <- (
  "Through this project, we found that global terrorism is truly a complex, widely impacted,
  and terrifying threat in the 21st century. Globally speaking, terrorism is the most severe 
  in terms of incident number and casualty number in the Middle East, Central America, and East
  and North Africa. Also, other areas like South Asia, South East Asia, Central Africa, 
  and the Northern part of South America suffer from terrorism frequently as well, 
  yet varied in different time over the last twenty years."
)

conclusion2 <- (
  "From the perspective of weapon, the most widely used weapons were explosives
  and firearms for every year except for 2001, which has an outlier in vehicles 
  bomb due to the massive nine-eleven plane hijack event occurred in the United States. 
  The sum of casualties of all other weapon types was dramatically lower than the sum of 
  casualties of explosives and firearms because of the lethality and range of modern weapons.
  Since the total number of casualties has been growing throughout the past twenty years, 
  the number of casualties of each attack type all increased over time. The most rapid 
  growth in casualties was caused by Armed Assault, Unknown, and Hostage Taking 
  (including barricade incident). One way to interpret this trend is that terrorists
  have become more dangerous (since more of them are armed), have more new intention 
  and means of attacking, as well as having more precise outcomes that they would like 
  to achieve (since kidnappings often associate with blackmailing). The only decreased 
  attack type is hijacking, due to the massive plane hijacking event known as nine eleven 
  in the United States, which only occurred in 2001 in the single year considering an outlier."
  )

conclusion3 <- ("
  Because explosives and firearms are way more powerful in terms of lethality than other
  weapons do, attacks with these two types of weapons caused much more casualties than 
  the sum of other weapons. Attack type is a decisive element for casualty numbers since 
  facility attacks and hijacking normally do not intend to have a big impact on people, 
  and unarmed assault and assassination normally do not have a massive impact either. 
  After all, bomb/explosion and armed assault are the main reasons for large casualties 
  with a similar reason for weapon types. In terms of geography and casualty numbers, 
  the highly dangerous areas that terrorist attacks would potentially take place also
  have more complexity pertaining to politics, religion, race, and other backgrounds.
  We suggest further potential research on global terrorism could work on the correlation
  among the above-mentioned element and weapon types by regions."

implication <- (
  'Isaac Asimov once said, "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."
  However, there are always incompetent terrorists choose to use violence. 
  Although terrorism seems far away from our life, it is happening every day 
  all around the world while sleeping, eating, or laughing. We hope that our 
  analysis can be utilized for preventing massive terrorist attacks and inspire
  international forces organizations to help people in war-torn and risky countries. 
  We hope that governments would control weapons more properly to reduce the 
  possibility of massive terrorist attacks. We also hope that our audience has
  some takeaways about global terrorism and make an impact on their hearts. This
  project might stop here, but our striving must never stop until terrorism is 
  eliminated, and the earth truly becomes a peaceful world.'

  '"From this project, the most important thing I have learned is the importance 
  of communication when working within a team. To me a good team player, I realized 
  I have the responsibility to constantly update my working progress, provide suggestions,
  and facilitate communication when working with my teammates. Also, I learned that 
  time management is crucial in order to deliver the project on time. For our project,
  we did not have any specific deadline about what should be done and as a result some 
  of the work was done in last minute rush. Thus, next time I will make a plan about 
  what should be done at what time right at the beginning of a project in order to avoid a situation like this."'

  'From this project, not only I developed the skills to do data wrangling but also learned the 
  importance of communication within the team. It is really important to divide the task to different 
  people and code different pieces. The project is really meaningful as it gives me the opportunity to
  learn more about the facts and statistics about global terrorist attacks and raises my awareness of this problem.
  It is important for everyone to do what they are good at so that everyone can work most effectively. 
Additionally, communication is the key. For example, in this project, we both focused on the part of 
the projects that we think we are good at. We also talked to each other throughout the whole time to 
solve problems that may occur or some confusion. This time I focused on the report part of the project.
In the future of the project, I think I will put more effort into the technical part which is like
building the website and writing the code. We also used envisioning cards a lot of times when we were
thinking about our data. The cards really help me to think from different perspectives which made me 
become a good thinker and innovator. For a better coder, I think I will develop it next time.'

  'Our group project has been overwhelming yet enlightening for me: as a student majoring in Communication
  and International Studies, I had to take extra steps in order to make sense of all the coding skills. 
  The collaborative environment also taught me to understand my teammates strengths and weaknesses and 
  to be open-minded with new ideas, and be flexible with my schedule. In the field of International
  Studies, my concentration is development, which evokes my interests in international sustainability.
  Since our topic is global terrorism, the project has given me a valuable opportunity to explore and 
  research an area that I had no previous knowledge about. Global terrorism is the issue that we human 
  need to properly address in order to achieve sustainability of the world. I look forward to doing more 
  research about the issue in the future. After completing the project, I am able to work with data and
  transform them into insightful information with more confidence. The project has definitely pushed me
  to develop my coding skills and critical thinking. I am so glad to see that we have concluded with
  some insightful findings after all. Good work, team! Cheers!'
