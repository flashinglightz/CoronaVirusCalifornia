The threat from terrorism remains high and could worsen over the decade. There are now more Islamist extremists from more countries active in more places than ever before. Extremists will continue to exploit fragile and violence-prone states, including in Southeast Asia. Globally, terrorism will add to instability and drive international security interventions, especially in the Middle East and Africa. According to an online summary of terrorism, over the past decade terrorism killed an average of 21,000 people each year. In 2017, terrorism is responsible for 0.05% of global death. In addition, the problem of terrorism is so complex because different cultures and ideologies define terrorism in various ways, and incidents happen in different ways that people have no time reacting. These facts are striking to the world suggesting that it is the problem that we humans should be aware of global terrorism and take initiatives.  

Our group project aims to gain insights from data visualizations about the relationship among geographcial regions, weapon types, and attack targets in order to analyze the essence of global terrorism.
